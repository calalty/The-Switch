## What did I do? 🤔

🎯 I built a real-time application called "The Switch" where users can create or join rooms, each featuring a switch that can be toggled on and off. When one user is interacting with the switch, others are unable to use it, ensuring exclusive control. This project was inspired by a need in our business to track sandbox environment usage without constant messaging. Instead, users can create a room to see who is currently using the sandbox. This application serves as a demonstration of what I learned from Sonny Sangha's tutorials.

## What could I improve? 🛠️

🎯 Expire JWT tokens
- To sign out the user if they haven't been active for a while

🎯 More ways to sign in
- Provide additional authentication methods to cater to a broader audience and alternative authentication providers.

🎯 Error handling and cacheing
- Consider using React Query
